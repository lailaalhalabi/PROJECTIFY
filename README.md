# Projectify - A Mobile Application

This project is a part of SOEN 357 at Concordia University, Montreal. <br/>

## Project goals:

This project aims to create a collaborative project-based learning platform that allows students to freely explore the technologies of interest while receiving the basis of knowledge from university lectures. Instead of following the traditional rigid scheme of formal project work from school where students are given a (fixed) topic to work on, the platform encourages students to learn and explore the topics of choice.<br/>
